Oxygen has been added to ExoRT with
  1. New k-tables from HITRAN 2020 via HELIOS-K in n68equiv and n84equiv
  2. Rayleigh scattering a la Vardavas & Carver/Allen
  3. CIA for O2-O2, O2-N2, O2-CO2 from HITRAN and sources therein

Ozone has been added to ExoRT (n68equiv & n84equiv)
  1. k-tables up to ~7000 cm^-1: HITRAN 2020 via HELIOS-K
  2. k-tables from ~10-50 k cm^-1: MolSpec (UBremen) sorted by HELIOS-K

The abundances of O2/O3 are pulled from the CESM Physics buffer, which means
that O2 is now pulled from exoplanet_mod.F90 into CESM. Because O3 is not a well
mixed gas, the profiles are pulled from ozone input files using the standard
CAM machinery. As such, the ozone file and other options need to be set in
user_nl_cam. I've added these options to the name lists for cam_aqua_fv,
cam_mixed_fv, and cam_land_fv. Right now, those are set to a file I provided
that has zero ozone everywhere. I don't have any experience with the other
configs, so users will need to check these carefully (and possibly create a new
ozone file with zero VMR that fits the configuration) to be sure they don't
have unwanted ozone leaking into their radiation. 

To add O2, in exoplanet_mod.F90, simply set the parameter: exo_o2bar

To add O3, there are two steps:
  1. In user_nl_cam set the parameters "prescribed_ozone_datapath" and
     "prescribed_ozone_file", making sure these point to an existing netCDF file
     with the ozone abundances as a function of lat, lon, lev, and time. CESM
     should automatically download some from the repository, or you can create
     your own based on the one I've pushed to ExoCAM. Ensure that the parameter
     "prescribed_ozone_cycle_yr" is an existing year in the netCDF, or the model
     will fail immediately.
  2. In exoplanet_mod.F90, you will probably need to adjust the parameter
     "exo_convect_plim". This limits convection a low pressure. The default
     ExoCAM value of 5 Pa doesn't work for modern Earth with O3. The original
     CESM value of 4000 Pa (40 mb) does work for that, but for very different
     atmospheres it may need to be something else. If the model fails quickly
     with errors from the convection scheme, adjusting this may help.
